LoveLetterApi
------------
This project has been made compatible with the [java api](https://www.github.com/drtnf/LoveLetter) provided by Dr Tim French.  
The model is created using tensor flow and interacts with the api via a java server that must be run before training.  
A future release will contain an agent capable of running the api just off saved model files.

Installation
------------
clone the java api repo, navigate to the parent directory
